# odin-recipes
Recipe website project

This project uses HTML knowledge that's been taught to me via odin up to this point.
The website itself contains links to various recipes using ONLY HTML.
By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated certain HTML skills such as setting up an HTML document, creating headings and paragraphs, creating lists, and using anchor tags.
